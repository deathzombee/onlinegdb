# 1). Create an input statement that asks the user to enter an integer number
# and store the number in a variable named operand1

# 6). In each if outcome perform the correct calculation for that operator type and store the answer into a variable called 'correctAnswer'

# 7). Test to see if the user's answer variable is the same '==' as the correct answer variable your program calculated and either print that they are correct or incorrect.
