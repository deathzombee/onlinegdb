# 1). Instantiate (create in a code command) a list variable named myNumbers and initialize the list to the integers
# from 1 through 10
myNumbers = [*range(1,11)]
print(myNumbers)
# 2). Create a variable named total and create and initialize the variable to the sum of all values stored in the
# list above using a formula that adds each value in the list into the new variable
total = 0
for x in myNumbers:
    total += x
# 3). Print on a single line the contents of the list with each element separated by a comma and a tab
for x in myNumbers:
    print(x, end=',\t')
# 4). Remove the element from the list containing the value of 5.
myNumbers.remove(5)
# 5). Remove the element at position 4 (4th item) in the list.
myNumbers.pop(3)
# 6). Add the value 5 back to the end of the list
myNumbers.append(5)
# 7). Insert the value 12 at position 5 in the list
myNumbers.insert(12,4)
# 8).  Print the entire content of the list using just the name of the list
print(myNumbers)
# 9).  Print the list sorted.
myNumbers.sort()

# 10). Pop the last three elements off the end of the list, storing each in a temporary variable, printing the
# variable and then popping the next value (pop, store, print, repeat 3
